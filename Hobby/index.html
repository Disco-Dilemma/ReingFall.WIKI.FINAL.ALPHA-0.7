                <h2>Creator's Note</h2>
                <p>Reignfall is a project I started as a response and critique to the isekai genre. With the oversaturation of the trope, I feel like there could be more to the genre rather than wish-fulfillment, power scaling and surface level ideas.</p>
                <p>I am what some define as a "conscious consumer" - I'm aware of what I want, so I create my own.</p>
                <p>My main sources of inspiration are <em>Roadside Picnic, The Witcher, Full-Metal Alchemist, Dying-Light 2, and Literature.</em></p>

                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p><strong>REIGNFALL: NEW HEAVEN, NEW EARTH</strong> is a world building and writing project, started as a passion project but will eventually be published as an online web-novel or series.</p>
                <p>It is a chronological anthology that follows people, factions, places and nations as they navigate their new reality.</p>
                <p>The age where humanity's main concern was survival is over. Now they look back, then forward, and must decide how they will thrive.</p>
